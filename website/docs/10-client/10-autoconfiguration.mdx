# Auto Configuration

Steps to autoconfigure gRPC stubs:
1. Configure the stub classes to be added as Spring Beans.
2. Configure request addresses for stub classes.

## Configure the Stub Classes

You can configure stub classes in two ways:

### `@EnableGrpcClients` annotation

```java
@EnableGrpcClients(basePackages = "io.grpc")
```

### Configuration

```yaml
grpc:
  client:
    base-packages: [ io.grpc ]
```

## Configure Request Addresses

```yaml
grpc:
  client:
    channels:
      - authority: localhost:9090
        stubs: [ io.grpc.*BlockingStub ]
      - authority: localhost:9091
        stubs: [ io.grpc.*FutureStub ]
```

## Other Configurations

You can also configure properties like `deadline` for the channel.

```yaml
grpc:
  client:
    channels:
      - authority: localhost:9090
        stubs: [ io.grpc.*BlockingStub ]
        deadline: 5000
```

Full configuration options can be found in the [reference](/docs/reference/configuration).
