Steps to autoconfigure gRPC stubs:
1. Specify the stubs to be added as Spring Beans.
2. Configure request addresses for stubs.

## Specify Stubs

You can configure stub classes in two ways.

### @EnableGrpcClients

`@EnableGrpcClients` can configure packages to scan or directly specify stub classes.

Configure packages to scan with `basePackages`:

```java
@EnableGrpcClients(basePackages = "io.grpc")
```

Specify stub classes directly with `clients`:

```java
@EnableGrpcClients(clients = { SimpleServiceGrpc.SimpleServiceBlockingStub.class })
```

You can also combine both ways:

```
@EnableGrpcClients(basePackages = "io.grpc", clients = { SimpleServiceGrpc.SimpleServiceBlockingStub.class })
```

:::tip
It's recommended to use `clients` to specify stub classes directly to avoid adding unnecessary beans into the container,
which can improve startup speed.
:::

### Configuration

Similar to `@EnableGrpcClients`, you can also specify packages to scan or stub classes via configuration files.

```yaml
grpc:
  client:
    base-packages: [ io.grpc ]
    stubs: [ io.grpc.testing.protobuf.SimpleServiceGrpc.SimpleServiceBlockingStub ]
```

## Configure Request Addresses

You can configure request addresses (authority) for different stub classes.
Stubs configured with the same channel will reuse that channel.

```yaml
grpc:
  client:
    channels:
      - authority: localhost:9090
        stubs: [ io.grpc.*BlockingStub ]
      - authority: localhost:9091
        stubs: [ io.grpc.*FutureStub ]
```

There are three ways to configure the stubs for a channel:

- Specify the fully qualified class name of the stub using `classes`.

  ```yaml
  grpc:
    client:
      channels:
        - authority: localhost:9090
          classes: [ io.grpc.testing.protobuf.SimpleServiceGrpc.SimpleServiceBlockingStub ]
    ```

- Use `stubs` to specify stub names with Ant-style patterns.

  ```yaml
  grpc:
    client:
      channels:
        - authority: localhost:9090
          stubs: [ io.grpc.*BlockingStub ]
    ```

- Specify the service name using `services`, e.g. `io.grpc.health.v1.HealthGrpc#SERVICE_NAME`.

  ```yaml
  grpc:
    client:
      channels:
        - authority: localhost:9090
          services: [ grpc.testing.SimpleService ]
    ```

:::info
The priority of the configuration methods is `classes` > `stubs` > `services`ã€‚
:::

## Other Configurations

You can also configure properties like `deadline` for the channel.

```yaml
grpc:
  client:
    channels:
      - authority: localhost:9090
        stubs: [ io.grpc.*BlockingStub ]
        deadline: 5000
```

Full configuration is available in the [`GrpcClientProperties`](/docs/reference/configuration).
