# Dynamic Refresh

This feature allows for the dynamic refreshing of gRPC stubs.
You can place your configuration settings with the `grpc.client` prefix in any configuration center (like [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul), [Apollo](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo), [Nacos](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos), etc.).
By changing these configurations (e.g. `authority`, `max-inbound-message-size`), gRPC stubs will automatically refresh without the need to restart your application.

This feature is disabled by default, you can enable it by using the following configuration:

```yaml
grpc:
  client:
    refresh:
      enabled: true
```

:::info
This feature requires `spring-cloud-context` in the classpath and a `RefreshEvent` to be published.
