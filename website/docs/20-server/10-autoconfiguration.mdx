# Auto Configuration

Start a gRPC server at *9090* with zero configuration.

## Register Services

You can register gRPC services by adding `@Component` based annotation to your service implementations.

```java
@Component
public class SimpleServiceImpl extends SimpleServiceGrpc.SimpleServiceImplBase {
    @Override
    public void unaryRpc(SimpleRequest request, StreamObserver<SimpleResponse> responseObserver) {
        var response = SimpleResponse.newBuilder().setResponseMessage("Hello " + request.getRequestMessage()).build();
        responseObserver.onNext(response);
        responseObserver.onCompleted();
    }
}
```

:::info
The framework provides a `@GrpcService` annotation to better distinguish bean types.
But it is not necessary at all; you can use Spring's built-in `@Component`/`@Service`/`@Controller` instead.

## In-process Server

gRPC server supports `in-process` transport, which is useful for testing scenarios.

```yaml
grpc:
  server:
    in-process:
      name: whatever
```

## Build-in Services

[`io.grpc:grpc-services`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.grpc/grpc-services) provides a series of built-in services.

### Health

[`Health`](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/health-checking/) service is enabled by default.

Use the following configuration to disable it:

```yaml
grpc:
  server:
    health:
      enabled: false
```

You can customize the health check logic by implementing the `HealthChecker` interface.

There are two build-in `HealthChecker` implementations, `DataSourceHealthChecker` and `RedisHealthChecker`.

`DataSourceHealthChecker` is enabled by default when the `spring-boot-starter-jdbc` is on the classpath.

`RedisHealthChecker` is enabled by default when the `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` is on the classpath.

Use the following configuration to disable them:

```yaml
grpc:
  server:
    health:
      datasource:
        enabled: false
      redis:
        enabled: false
```

### Reflection

[`Reflection`](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/reflection/) is disabled by default, it's often used in development and debugging scenarios.

Use the following configuration to enable it:

```yaml
grpc:
  server:
    reflection:
      enabled: true
```

### Channelz

[`Channelz`](https://grpc.io/blog/a-short-introduction-to-channelz/) is disabled by default.

Use the following configuration to enable it:

```yaml
grpc:
  server:
    channelz:
      enabled: true
```

## Other Configurations

Full configuration is available in the [`GrpcServerProperties`](/docs/reference/configuration).
