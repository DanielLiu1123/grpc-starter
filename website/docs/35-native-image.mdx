# Native Image

**Starting with version [3.3.5.1](https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/grpc-starter/releases/tag/v3.3.5.1)**, this project supports native image compilation using GraalVM.
This feature lets you compile your gRPC services into native executables that run without a JVM.

## Example

Refer to the [native-image example](https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/grpc-starter/tree/main/examples/native-image).

:::warning
Netty supports GraalVM native-image, but grpc-netty-shaded does not.
So, donâ€™t use shaded Netty in your project if you want to compile it into a native image.

Adding GraalVM native-image support to grpc-netty-shaded is not part of this project.
grpc-netty-shaded needs to resolve this problem.
